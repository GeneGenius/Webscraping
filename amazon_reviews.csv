Ok, so overall, this watch, like said, is pretty ok. I have been using it for a week now, and I think that it fits me practically perfectly, but maybe not for other people. I think that for the price,  it really is probably the best smartwatch you could get under $100.As promised in the labeling, it does have a very large display, but it makes up for that large size in two ways. 1: instead of the regular two supporting little stubs on the side, the band is attached directly to the watch itself, and 2: the band is much smaller, and because of the 2.5 d curved screen, it really feels comfortable on your wrist. It also has great features that you would find on, an Apple watch, or other great smartwatches. The scrolling is great, and because it runs on Zepp OS, the UI, special features, and more are not just better, but there are also more. It has a 300 mAh battery, and depending on the usage, it can actually last even more than the predicted 10 days, and can, at least in my experience, even up to 20 days, much better than the Apple, or Galaxy watches that rule the smartwatch world.  The built-in Alexa is pretty slick but like all other  Amazfit watches, the functionality is not the best, but unlike other Amazfit watches, the Alexa speaks, and you can read it too, which is something that the older ones can't. Now about the flaws, I'm going to be comparing this watch to the Amazfit GTS series, specifically the GTS 2. One thing that I noticed right away when I was doing my research was that the watch is not waterproof. it is water resistant, but only ip 68 if I'm not wrong. This means that it can withstand rain and dust, but you can't wear it during showers, and definitely not in a pool. Another flaw is that even though the watch is mostly better than the GTS 2, the GTS 2 does have the ability to play music on the watch itself, but I feel like that is quite unnecessary because you can just play it on your phone, or if you really want to be able to play the songs of your dreams, let me warn you, the music quality isn't that good. This may be a minor thing,  but it does find it annoying because unlike the GTS', the bip 5 doesn't have quick /shortcuts, like double crown click and hold crown. Other than that this watch is something that I'd wholeheartedly recommend this watch to you, but if you are a hard-core fitness trainer, this watch might not be the best for you. It's a smartwatch, not a fitness tracker. If you want a good fitness tracker, then I recommend the Fitbit versa's.

I have had several FitBit watches and my most recent smart watch was a Garmin and when I started having problems with my Garmin, I bought a cheapo exercise/smart watch before buying this AmazFit Bip 5. I wouldn't trade it for anything else.Top Reasons:1. Large clear screen - I have to use reading glasses, with the other watches I could squint to see in general where a message was from but not read any of the message. With this big screen, I don't have to pull out my readers to get a quick preview of the messages.2. Battery life - it has been amazing and the watch warns you about features which take more battery.3. Configuration of messages - Garmin was pretty good at allowing me to choose which messages to see on the watch. This AmazFit is much better and the messages are grouped better on the watch.4. Alexa built-in - This has been nice but not a deal maker or deal breaker. It is nice to talk to and hear from Alexa on my watch.5. Exercise and fitness - I feel like this watch and app was quite a step up from my Garmin experience which I felt was already top-of-line. It has already helped me change my exercise routine.6. Sound - I like that the watch can play messages. I like the workout summary that it reads off at the end of a workout.Other things:================Watch faces: There aren't as many as Garmin and few free ones. But I was able to find a couple that I like and the price was very reasonable. Currently I am using ""Versatile Digits"". Also, some of the faces allow you to modify the layout on the watch and you can switch between installed faces directly on the watch.Phone App: It has been very stable and I like it well enough (better than two separate apps with Garmin). Some initial challenges finding things, but no big complaints.

Apparently Amazon considers the AMAZFIT 3 Pro and the AMAZFIT 5 the same product so the bottom is my original review of the AMAZFIT 3 Pro while the top is the newer 5.AMAZFIT BIP 5First the Black watch is very grey.  I first thought they sent me the wrong one but they don't make a grey model.  The face is black but the sides/back and band are medium grey.  I hate rubber watch bands and replaced it with a nice black stainless steel band.  I expected to do this going in.  They provide a cheap grey rubber band like every other watch maker out there.Software interface Zepp.  The Zepp interface is very cryptic and hard to use.  It takes a lot of time to find what you are looking for as nothing is where you would expect it.  After a while you kind of learn it.  Once you get the watch setup you will rarely use the Zepp interface.  If your into following everything it tracks then that is on the main screen as you enter the app.  I cannot say how well it tracks stuff as I really just bought a watch.Watch faces.  You would think a smart what would have some good  and basic watch faces but in reality the ones include are pretty lame.  If you are looking for a watch with hands there are a few good ones.  If you are looking for a digital watch they are mostly bad.  There is very little you can customize.  I ended up using one where I supplied the back ground and you could put one item above like a date and below like the weather.  You could not change the color of the print though which means you have to specifically look for backgrounds that will show white text.Getting notifications set correctly is not easy.  You will also be double, tipple and quadruple notified of some things like emails or texts.  It almost seems like when ever the phone sees a notification even though it is not sent to watch it resends the last message it will send.  So you end up being notified of same message over and over again.  A few comparisons of the 5 to the 3 Pro.  The 5 has a slightly bigger screen.  More in look than feel as you would not notice it on your arm.  The screen allows more to be shown in messages sent which is helpful.  Overall the bigger display is a good thing.  It did not get to big as to be giant on the arm.  You can answer phone calls on the 5 which you cannot on the 3 pro.  That was the main reason I got it.  Battery life.  I charged it Friday,  It is now Wednesday and it is at 51%.  There 10 days battery life is a pretty good estimate.  I would guess you charge it every weekend and your good.  Screen Sensitivity.  Operating the screen means you are swiping up down left and right.  Down gets you settings,  Left or right gets you basic apps and health tracking.  if in one of those swiping right is return (which is the only one that really does not work well).  Up gets you texts and emails.  If you hit the button it will bring up installed apps.Overall I am happy with the purchase.  Once setup it works well it just takes a little to get to that point.AMAZFIT BIP 3 ProMy first attempt to buy a smart watch was years ago  as a samsung watch and there were just to many issues.  It was bulky and batter life as maybe 2 days.  So I went back to a real watch because that's all I really needed.  Fast forward to 2022 and Black Friday.  I picked up the Amazfit Bip 3 Pro for around 50.00.My first impression was it was a good size. My wrists are small and it was in the size range I wanted.  It is very light with the included band and a little heavier with my replacement SS band.  Really in the range of any watch though.My second thought was on the band.  It was a rubberized substance which I really hate.  I used it for about a week and decided it was not for me.  I was worried but this uses a standard size and there are a lot of bands out there that will fit this on Amazon. I ended up getting a stainless steel replacement for 10.00.  and just love it.The Battery life is spot on their estimate.  It claimed 14 days.  I am past 14 days at 19% power.  To me this is good.  You can charge it every 2 weeks and not be worried you will run out towards the end.The movement to turn on seems well done.  It comes on when you move your wrist to view but really does not come on by just moving your wrist or arm.  You will need to remember to turn this feature off at night.  You can set times when it is active.  I have mine set from 7AM to 11PM and if I need it after that just hit the button.  If you don't it will come on when you don't want it to and its bright.There are a minimal number of clock faces.  It would be nice if there were more.  I actually use the default and have one standard watch face if I want to look fancier.You can get text and email notifications but they are not the best.  You cannot reply to anything though.You can answer calls but there is no mic or speaker so it really does you know good.  Im not sure I want to look like Dick Tracey and talk into my arm.I don't really use the measuring features as I really just wanted a watch.  I have played with them and they seem to be right but I really have no way to tell that.I bought this as a watch and the battery life and screen resolution make this a good choice.Overall I bought this

So many things I could say about this Amazfit Bip 5. But the highlights: 1) Battery life is almost off the charts. I can go 35 days on one charge with light daily usage. Checking time, checking some of the data. Way more than the advertised amount, though your mileage may vary. 2) The screen is sharp and clear with vibrant colors. I can read it in bright sunlight as well as in darkness, and the screen looks awesome. 4) It has every medical data point that most people will ever need. It does not, however, read blood pressure or sugar levels. But then, how many smart watches do?  5) It has a decent size and variety in the free ZEPP App Library. And if you can’t find your app there, there is an immediate connection to the ZEPP App Store. 6) The watch face at first glance seems large, but when I compare it to my wife’s Apple Watch, it’s the same. 7) Entry into the watch requires button presses. For example, to check time I have to make a button press. From there I can use the button or finger to navigate. This means that your watch won’t keep turning on because of an errant touch.8). The ZEPP app is a vital part of the watch’s success. The app is free in the Apple App Store. I don’t know about the Android store, but I presume it’s the same. It gives much more detailed and complete information of all the data the watch tracks. Charts, graphs and explanations. It also gives appropriate notifications if you want them. They can be turned off. 9) Battery levels, steps, heart rate are displayed in real time. 10). And oh yeah, it keeps great time. I can’t recommend this any higher. It’s awesome.

Before trying out the Amazfit Bip Pro, I had been using a Fitbit Charge 4, and while I liked it, (the communication between it, the scale and app was stellar) it was beginning to show its age, and I didn't really care for the fiddling of the charger. When the band housing broke, I decided to try out an Amazfit, which had good reviews, a better price,  and magnetic connectivity with the charger. It required a download of the Zepp app, which connected to the watch easily.There are things the Fitbit + App does better, notably caloric intake,  where you can add what you eat over a given day. There's no available scales to connect to the Bip without a 3rd party app, so I have to input my weight manually.  But almost everything else, the Bip Pro 3 has in spades.The Bip has a much bigger, easier to read face in full color, and a lot of (paywall, but inexpensive) available downloadable styles.  It's light and easy to forget in wearing it.  The price is obviously better, too: for the price of a Charge,  I could get the Bip Pro 3, a magnetic base charger and a set of face protectors and spare bands.  The Zepp app is reasonably polished,  and the Zepp Aura gives you some decent relaxation, meditation and sleep sounds.It's only been a couple weeks, but so far, I couldn't be happier!

I wanted to wait until the battery died before I wrote a review, but I am getting impatient, so here it is. So far, the battery has lasted 36 days... I charged it when I first got it, and haven't put it on the charger since. It is at 11% now and I suspect I'll get another week out of it. I don't use the fitness stuff aside from the heart rate monitor, so I figure that's why the battery lasts so long for me. It has been great for getting messages without having to take my phone out, and it's good for use as a music controller, clock/timer, etc. I have no complaints. Great smartwatch for the money, and I am very happy with it.

I waited a bit to write this review so I can wear the watch daily for while and get a feel for the operation and accuracy. First off the battery life is amazing. Even with high usage its still really good. I charged mine for the first time after a week of already using it right out of the box. it had 65% charge when I started it up the first time and it still has 35% after a week of use. The different fitness tracking functions work well when they are initiated to do so. what I mean by that is if you just leave the watch on and it tracks your heart rate frequently as well as calculating steps, the calorie burned count is significantly lower than when the watch is in any of the workout modes. there are a lot of workout modes which include things like yoga and simple stretching to more specific workouts. the difference is roughly 4 to 5 times as many calories burned when its in the workout modes vs when not. It should be closer if the watch is still tracking your heart rate and steps and so forth. I tried to keep it in workout mode all day but it times out at some point and loses the fitness data. its safer to do it in 2 or 3 hour increments if you want continuous accurate calorie data for the whole day. I do wish it had blood pressure measurement but I think you have to move up to a higher model for that. Other than that the GPS works pretty well and when it is in a workout mode it seems to have pretty accurate measurements in terms of overall calories burned. I compared it to other fitness trackers that I have used and I think it is more accurate than most in this price bracket. It is a very comfortable watch. light weight and durable. The phone app is neat and the multitude of available watch faces both free and for sale $1 to $2 are awesome. I change mine all the time just for fun. I will continue to use and update this review after a few months.

Amazfit bip 5...(9/2023)....So, I have only had this watch for a few days. I am not loving it. In fact probably going to return it. I absolutely hate, hate, hate the 4 digit time display (did I mention I hate the 4 digit time display)?. Even on the 12 hour time setting it always shows a 4 digit display. No matter what watch face you pick. If it is 7:15 in the evening (PM) the display definitely should not say 0715...ummmm, that is AM not PM. this is one of the absolute reasons why I hate this watch.The app takes some time to explore and learn. You have to really explore and maybe a few YouTube videos to figure out. It wants you to pay for some items/games/faces etc. I  don't think I know anyone who would purchase the ""offered items"".The watch band....I  have seen alot of negative reviews on it. I myself don't mind it overly much, even though it isn't the best. Very cheap. The hardest part is taking it off. The band (this is hard to describe) tucks under the band and against your wrist, there is no buckle like you would find on normal watch bands. I think it is going to eventually break and probably relatively  soon, if I would keep this watch (which I am currently doubting) I would get a different band.I have not gotten it wet yet so I can't comment on the water resistant of it.Connectivity....ie Bluetooth...I still have to have my phone within 10 feet of the watch or I get nothing.  My phone is less than 3 years old (as of 2023), so not entirely sold that my phone is outdated.  Reconnecting takes a few minutes even after I am back within range of my phone.  Reconnecting ""Alexa"" takes even longer. Very disappointing , all around.Music....advertising says play music on your wrist.....not so, you can only control music functions if your phone is playing music.Health data....I  am undecided if this is any where accurate.  So far it has yet to record my sleep data (even after a few nights of having it on), so I am not sure yet if I need to tell it I am going to  sleep or not. I would think that would be automatic.  The app as far as I can see doesn't let you change your sleep schedule parameters.It does have a do not disturb option that will allow you to choose the times. I  have not used it yet.Over all, I would NOT recommend this watch, I am probably going to return it and save up for another Garmin watch,  which is what I have used for over 10 years. But they are not cheap and don't last as long as a cheap $10 watch that only tells time. Maybe I will go back to that.

I've had this watch for at least 3 weeks and I've only charged it once. I previously had another Amazfit but wanted to get a new one with a larger screen and longer battery life. I do appreciate the extra features such as being able to take a call on my watch and respond back to text messages. I do get double or triple copies of a text at times but I've gotten used to it and just delete them as they come in. This watch saves me from having to carry my phone everywhere around the house to prevent missing phone calls. It's a solid buy for a watch that is under $100. I will say I only use the watch for the basics. Not exercising or monitoring various health indicators. I'm sure that would factor in to the battery life. Gave it a 4 because the app can be difficult to navigate and receiving duplicates of a text message.
